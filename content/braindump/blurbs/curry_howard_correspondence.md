The Curry-Howard correspondence was something I found out about too late.
In essence, it shows that mathematical proofs are equivalent to computer programs. 
Since then, I've been curious about type theory and what it means to use a theorem prover or type checker.
In particular, I want to use these tools to write formally verified software.

Curry-Howard gives us the following diagram of equivalences:
